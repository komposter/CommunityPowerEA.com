CommunityPower — is the EA made by the community. So, what does the development process look like?

### Implement
After all, I implement new functions to the EA, upload it to the market and to the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/CommunityPowerNews/3), add a short description 
to the [Versions history]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/versions-history/) page, and we go to the [backtesting and optimization]({{site.baseurl}}/backtesting-and-optimization/).

### Share
Most interesting strategies can be shared at the [Community forum](https://forum.communitypowerea.com/communities/4-strategies-and-set-files).
Other members can backtest your set-file with other brokers, suggest improvements, etc.

Threads with set-files can also be voted on the forum, so you can find the most popular strategies or become the most popular author!

# Brokers

You can trade with any broker you want.
But results can differ because of trading conditions (spread, commission, slippages, etc.) and different quotes (yep, even on the same instrument).

To choose the cheapest broker with MT4 you can use free [TradingCost EA](https://tradingcost.org/).

To choose a broker with MT5 you should compare trading costs yourself.

Use my IB-links for registration, and you’ll have better trade conditions (commission discount, lower spread, etc).

## Recommended brokers
I can recommend a few brokers I trade with, and even make better trading conditions for some of them:

## Brokers with cent accounts
If you do not have enough money for safe trading, you can open a cent-account and your $100 deposit will be shown as $10 000 in the terminal (and your $1000 profit will be $10 after withdrawal, of course).

Here is the list of brokers with cent-accounts available:

| Broker                                                                                                       | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Better conditions for existing clients
### IC-Markets
If you already have an account at **IC-Markets** and want to migrate to my IB-group (and have the commission discount), please, write a short email to **_partners@icmarkets.com_**, say them you want to move into my IB group (**Partner ID = 6173**) and that I provide you some service (write EA for MT4/MT5). If they answer you are already under another IB, you should register a new cabinet (with new email) using [my link](https://icmarkets.com/?camp=6173), and ask them to approve your new account and transfer all the money (it is fast and free).

### OctaFX
If you are an existing OctaFx client, you can move under my umbrella with your existing account using [this link](https://my.octafx.com/change-partner-request/). All you need is to provide my ID (**13629030**) and reason for moving (something like 'Good EA writing service').

### Other brokers
If you are an existing client of another broker, you can ask them to move you under my IB-group.
In most cases, they will do it, and you will have better conditions.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

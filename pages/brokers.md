# Brokers

You can trade with any broker you want.
But results can differ because of trading conditions (spread, commission, slippages, etc.) and different quotes (yep, even on the same instrument).

A list of good reliable brokers I trade with is [on the community forum](https://communitypowerea.userecho.com/en/communities/7/topics/295-how-to-choose-a-good-broker-what-brokers-do-you-trade-with).

Brokers with cent accounts (for the grid set or for a small budget) [are here](https://communitypowerea.userecho.com/en/communities/7/topics/296-how-to-choose-broker-with-cent-account-for-grid-sets-or-low-budget).

Use my IB-links for registration, and youâ€™ll have better trade conditions (commission discount, lower spread, etc).

# Donate

If you like my work and want to support me, you can do it in many ways.

### Open trading account using [my partner link](/brokers)
Every time you or EA open the trade, I’ll be rewarded. So, it is like patronage, but completely free for you. Furthermore, you’ll have a commission discount and other benefits!

A list of good reliable brokers [is here](/brokers). If you already have an account, you can transfer it to my IB group and have some advantages.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
